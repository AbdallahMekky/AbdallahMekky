I’ve been building for the web since the days of table layouts and blinking <marquee>s. From WordPress and Laravel to Angular v2 and now React, I’ve grown with the web — and never stopped learning.

Today I focus on frontend development using **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. I’m currently diving into `Astro`, `Strapi`, and `Sanity`, and I’m excited to explore `Go`, `Rust`, and `C#` in the future to expand my ability to build across the full stack — and even deeper.

I care about clean code, fast interfaces, and software that lasts.
