# The Story
After years of building digital experiences, I realized my real passion is helping people live stronger, healthier lives.

Now, I’m on a journey to becoming a fitness coach and nutrition expert—learning, growing, and applying what I know to improve myself and those around me.

I’m also learning new languages because I love exploring different cultures and ways of thinking.

Growth isn’t just about the body, it’s about the mind too.

I believe fitness is more than just workouts—it’s a mindset and a lifestyle. If you're on a similar path or looking for motivation, let’s connect and grow together!
