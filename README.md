As a freelance Frontend Engineer, I design and build scalable, high-performance web applications tailored to diverse client needs. Using React, Next.js, and TypeScript, I deliver accessible, responsive, and pixel-perfect interfaces that prioritize performance, maintainability, and user experience.

My journey began in the early 2000s with HTML4 and table-based layouts, evolving into WordPress (2008–2014), then full-stack Laravel (2014–2017). I fell in love with Angular during the v2 era and spent 2014–2016 combining frontend work with SEO consulting to help clients grow their presence and performance online.

Today, I’m focused on modern frontend engineering with React, and constantly expanding my stack. I’m currently learning Astro, Strapi, and Sanity to go deeper into the headless ecosystem. I'm also preparing to explore lower-level and systems-adjacent technologies like Go, Rust, and C# in the near future — driven by a love for performance, architecture, and long-term scalability.
